i) fork: Creates a new process by duplicating the existing process. The new process is called the child process, and the existing process is called the parent process. The child process gets a copy of the parent process's memory.

ii) exec: Replaces the current process image with a new process image. It loads a new program into the current process's address space and starts its execution.
