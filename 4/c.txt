readdir: The readdir command is not directly executable in UNIX command line. It is a C library function used to read the next directory entry from a directory stream opened using opendir. The example above demonstrates its usage.

To execute the opendir and readdir commands, you would compile and run the C program provided above using a C compiler such as gcc. The output will list the contents of the current directory.
