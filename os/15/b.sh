b. Execution of fork and exec Commands in UNIX
fork: The fork command in UNIX is not directly executable from the command line. It is a system call used to create a new process (child process) that is a copy of the calling process (parent process).

exec: The exec command in UNIX is also not directly executable from the command line. It is used with other commands (e.g., exec ls) to replace the current process image with a new process image.
