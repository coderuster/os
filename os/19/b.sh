Execution of 'close' and 'stat' Commands in UNIX
close: The close command in UNIX is not typically executed directly from the command line. It is a system call used to close a file descriptor after its use.

stat: The stat command in UNIX is used to display detailed information about a file or filesystem.

Syntax:
stat file_name
stat myfile.txt  # Displays detailed information about myfile.txt
